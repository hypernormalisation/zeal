# Early Sunwell gearing strats for humans

## Conditions

- Assumes starting point of P4 BiS.
- Sim settings: 1.5s CS delay. BM hunter, imp BS Solarian, enhance, no feral. Low armor boss, no fillers. Default fight length.


## Getting an early Shard

```
P4 BiS                        : 2565dps
P4 BiS /w Shard over Zerker's : 2543dps
```

Shard on its own is a dps loss compared to Berzerker's Call.
However, with **Hard Khorium Band** and **Gloaves of the Immortal Dusk** equipped, the dps stacks up like so:

```
DST/Zerkers  : 2615dps
DST/Shard    : 2674dps
```

So, shard lets you unequip Shapeshifters and Searing Grip, which by P5 are certainly showing their age, for a 109dps upgrade.

For wishlists, we can now consider possible single-item upgrades that *don't juggle hit*, and are *not highly contested*.
Where necessary we shuffle gems to maintain meta (see notes).

```
T |      SLOT |                       OLD ITEM -> NEW ITEM                  | DPS  | UPGRADE   | NOTES
====================================================================================================================
S |    WEAPON |            Torch of the Damned -> Apolyon                   | 2732 | 58dps     |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A |      LEGS |          Bow-stitched Leggings -> Felfury Legplates         | 2726 | 52dps     | default gems, +4str bonus
A |     WAIST |     Belt of One-Hundred Deaths -> Lightbringer Girdle       | 2762 | 52dps     | purple in Lightbringer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B |      BACK |                Cloak of Fiends -> Cloak of Unforgivable Sin | 2711 | 37dps     | orange in Unforgivable
B |      FEET |           Shadowmaster's Boots -> Lightbringer Boots        | 2708 | 34dps     | 29 expertise
B |      NECK |        Pendant of the Perilous -> Clutch of Demise          | 2706 | 32dps     | 
B |    WRISTS | Bindings of Lightning Reflexes -> Lightbringer Bands        | 2702 | 28dps     | 29 expertise
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C | SHOULDERS |   Shoulderpads of the Stranger -> Pauldrons of Berserking   | 2695 | 21dps     | default gems, +3str bonus
C |      HEAD |                           CVOS -> Duplicitous Guise         | 2689 | 15dps     |
C |    FINGER |            Band of Devastation -> Band of Ruinous Delight   | 2689 | 15dps     |
```

The issue here is that the bands/bracers bring you over expertise cap. To make better use of them, you should drop the expertise from strangers too.

## T6.5 offpieces without Strangers

Here are their dps upgrades over their P4 counterparts if you have **Pauldrons of Berserking**:

```
T |      SLOT |                       OLD ITEM -> NEW ITEM            | DPS  | UPGRADE   | NOTES
====================================================================================================================
S |      FEET |           Shadowmaster's Boots -> Lightbringer Boots  | 2757 | 60dps     | 27 expertise
S |    WRISTS | Bindings of Lightning Reflexes -> Lightbringer Bands  | 2755 | 57dps     | 26 expertise
```

This is much more in line with the gain for non-humans from these items.


## Trinkets later in the phase

Each of the T6.5 offpieces is BiS in its own right by some way regardless of expertise cap.
Once the player has acquired all three, and has Pauldrons of Berserking, how does the dps stack up between Zerkers, Shard, and BNS?
The rest of the gear slots are P4 BiS.

```
  TRINKET | DPS  | EXPERTISE
================================
 Zerker's | 2822 | 20 Expertise
    Shard | 2829 | 31 Expertise
    BNS   | 2832 | 20 Expertise   
```

So while BNS is still technically best-in-slot, it's only by 3dps - even when 5/11 of the expertise on Shard is wasted.
And let's face it - you're not getting a BNS.
 
It therefore probably makes sense to assume for non-humans that you will use Shard for the entire expansion once you have it.
