# Early Sunwell gearing strats for non-humans

## Conditions
- Assumes starting point of P4 BiS.
- Sim settings: 1.5s CS delay. BM hunter, imp BS Solarian, enhance, no feral. Low armor boss, no fillers. Default fight length.

```
P4 BiS = 2519dps
```

## Getting an early Shard
First prio:
- get Shard asap, it opens up so much for ret gearing now you can take off old expertise pieces.
- then get a Hard Khorium Band and Gloves of Immortal Dusk (both BoE craftables).

```
new setup = 2626dps
```

That gives you 107dps over P4 BiS immediately before a single raid drop, and you get rid of your two weakest pieces.
For wishlists, we can now consider possible single-item upgrades that *don't juggle hit*, and are *not highly contested*.
Where necessary we shuffle gems to maintain meta (see notes).

B |      BACK |                Cloak of Fiends -> Cloak of Unforgivable Sin | 36dps     | orange in Unforgivable
B |      NECK |        Pendant of the Perilous -> Clutch of Demise          | 31dps     | 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C | SHOULDERS |   Shoulderpads of the Stranger -> Pauldrons of Berserking   | 23dps     | default gems, +3str bonus
C |      HEAD |                           CVOS -> Duplicitous Guise         | 17dps     |
C |    FINGER |            Band of Devastation -> Band of Ruinous Delight   | 15dps     |
```

The T6.5 feet/wrists are insane upgrades, comparable to Apolyon, and you want them asap. They might be worth dropping some wishlist prio on, assuming that Thalassian Ranger Gauntlets/BCT are going to be heavily contested by other physical dps.

These items also mean that your shoulder upgrade is more impactful with the extra expertise; assuming you have both Lightbringer Boots/Bands, Pauldrons become an upgrade of 47dps instead of 23dps.

**Conclusions**

If you have six warlocks/worried about tier:
1. T6.5 boots
2. T6.5 bands
3. T6.5 belt

Else:
1. Cloak of Unforgivable Sin
2. Bladed Chaos Tunic
3. Clutch of Demise
