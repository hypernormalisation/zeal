# A general-purpose single-target priority for ret

tl;dr: regardless of fight length, using 
```
JoW > CS > DS > Cons > Exo > HW
```
outside of execute phase, and
```
HoW > JoW > CS > Cons > DS > Exo > HW
```
inside execute phase, is going to be a fine prio system for almost any situation against undead you find yourself in.

For non-undead, just trim Holy Wrath off the bottom. I doubt you're going to see huge swings in your damage by using alternate prios, but this one has a couple of real-life considerations baked in that I think make it worth running.

Note: this document uses the term "cast sequence" to describe the series of casts that a deterministic tool like the sim uses at given settings. It has *nothing to do* with `/castsequence` in the WoW API, or with one-button macros.

## Prio Tooling

Sulis' new ret prioritiser tool lets us quickly evaluate priorities across a variety of fight lengths.
It's a great tool, and you can find it at:
https://thesorm.github.io/Ret-Prioritizer

People are finding that the optimal rotations derived from both the Ret Sim (https://wowsims.github.io/wotlk/retribution_paladin) and from Sulis' tool can vary significantly according to fight lengths, even when the variance in fight length is set to be quite high.

I believe that while evaluating prio w.r.t practical fight times can be interesting, placing too much emphasis on these prio rankings might not be wise, for a couple of reasons.

### Ideal play in the final GCDs
You, as a player with a rough knowledge of how long in the encounter you have left, will play a fight differently than a basic prio system.

For instance, in a prio with Cons > Exo > HW (i.e. most good ones for clash resolution, sometimes including DS below Cons), you know not to cast a Consecrate over an available alternative when e.g. Noth the Plaguebringer is at 5% hp, because he's probably dying in about 2 GCDs, and you won't get enough consecrate ticks off for it to be worthwhile. The sim doesn't account for this, only casting according to prio.

|:--:| 
| *A cast sequence from the sim where consecrate is favoured over an available exorcism cast at the very close of the fight* |

When simming at real-world fight times, these effects can result in significant dps swings.

### N-cast edge effects
There are also issues with certain fight times just "dividing into" your high cooldown abilities like Exo or HW particularly well, to the point where a 2-3s fight length change can increase e.g. your effective Exorcism dps by a huge fraction by getting, say, 6 casts instead of 5 casts in the generated sequence.

### Variable Fight Length
Both the sim and Sulis' tool get around this to some extent by introducing variance to the fight length:
- the sim lets you select a central fight time and a variance, and then randomly selects a fight time each iteration with a uniform selection between the highest and lowest possible times.
- Sulis' tool scans the cast sequences generated at each timestep between the min and max fight times

This aims to produce enough different cast sequences from which to sample, that on average:
- optimal and suboptimal closing sequences get averaged out
- differences between overall numbers of casts at given time thresholds get averaged out.

But... what fight length variance is required to totally get rid of these effects? The answer doesn't seem at all obvious to me.
Are suboptimal cast sequences vs optimal cast sequences periodic with respect to total fight time? If so, over what time variance do they average out? Are they instead more localised and in clumps?

Assuming no haste procs and with a predefined haste-related cooldown usage (Potion of Speed/Hyperspeed Accelerators), the cast sequence at a given fight length, for a given prio, is deterministic, i.e. always the same.

But this does not mean that the generated sequences between close fight times are similar. This is because the sim enters the execution phase at a different point in the rotation even across fight length changes of just 1-2s, and the fight after that point often looks totally different between, say, a 102 second and a 104 second fight.

### Checking this out in actual cast sequences

I took a look at the cast sequences generated by the sim for 2 prios:
1. HoW > JoW > CS > DS > Cons > Exo > HW
2. HoW > JoW > CS > Cons > DS > Exo > HW

The scattering of suboptimal closing casts and threshold effects was often very localised with very few discernable patterns, even over 30-40s intervals.

For instance, the first prio had a particularly bad region of around 95-105s where it was consistently casting consecrate for its final GCD and getting between 0 and 2 ticks off, where either Exo or HW were available. The second prio didn't have this issue at all in that range.

So, someone simming a fight length of say, 90s +/- 15s, may find prio one artificially deflated in dps compared to prio two at the level of around 50-100dps, and might conclude that it's worth to prio Cons over DS in this situation, when in reality it probably doesn't matter very much at all.

## What simming at a real-world time range actually measures

When simming different fight lengths and evaluating different prios, you're conflating a bunch of different effects. Some you genuinely care about, like:
- cooldown clash resolution
- number of casts over a fight

But also some you don't care about, like
- the likelihood of suboptimal closers in the final GCDs
- how well the rotation syncs up with the execute phase on average across the fight range when played perfectly and without any variance at all

These latter factors are less important for actual play. We should all know how to close out a fight by casting any hard-hitting abilities available to you, or close to off cooldown. e.g. if I can cast a consecrate or alternately wait 0.5s for HoW to come off cooldown as the boss is dying, HoW is probably the better call because we're weighing up an almost guaranteed 700ish damage tick against a possible 9-10k nuke.

You also have to move the boss in some fights and can no longer cast consecrate. You can have to cast a quick heal or a utility spell, and suddenly everything in your rotation desyncs. After that point, it's very hard to imagine what the new sequence looks like, and how long it takes for it to resync, if it even does at all.

As such, it's really not worthwhile in my opinion to try and derive optimal rotations at given fight times; real world fights have too much variance, and the sim conflates too many different, hard to measure things.

What we should perhaps do, is find an overall prio that consistently performs well, and stick to it.

### A note on adaptive prios
Sulis is thinking about working on an adaptive prio to deploy in the tooling that will be very useful to this end.
Once it's validated there, it might make its way into his weak aura, which would be incredibly powerful.

Towards that end, let's try to isolate the general-purpose effects that actually make for a good prio.

# What makes a good prio?

In a FCFS rotation that attempts to maximise dps, you care about the following:
- maximising the number of high impact casts given the time available to you, especially when that time is short (e.g. execution phase)
- lowering the cooldown clash of abilities, and reducing the open GCD time (when you're off GCD but have no dps abilities to cast)
- lowering the "Effective Cooldown" of abilities in the rotation, where you generally want lower cooldown abilities used more quickly. For instance, if you delay CS by 3s, you effectively lose on average 50% of a CS cast in opportunity cost for casting other abilities. If you delay Exo by 3s, you comparatively lose 20% of an exo cast.

It'd be nice to have a "standard rotation" that performs well on paper and in the sim, that someone can use across all fight lengths, and to fall back upon when their rotation gets interrupted.

# Isolating cooldown clash with extreme fight times

Some of the above effects that we do care about can be isolated from the undesirable ones by running extremely long fights with high degrees of time variance.
That way you really cut down on the effects of N cast edge effects (especially in execution phases with HoW), and patterns of suboptimal final casts arising over time ranges for a given prio.

Let's run on Sulis' prio tool between 800s and 1200s, 0.5s timestep.
We'll use a miss chance of 0.5%, representative of most people's gearsets while training on one of the BiS or close-to-BiS P1 setups

We'll show the top 100 results for posterity at the bottom of this note.

For now let's take the top 20, and prune anything with JoW below third prio, because you might run into mana issues on longer fights. That gets rid of 3. The difference between the top and the bottom is about 19dps. This isn't very significant!

```

Let's posit that we can conduct some meta-analysis of these rotations that, when combined with real-life considerations, can inform our standard rotation.
We'll also restrict ourselves to choosing one of these top rotations for our generally recommended one, because we know that each of these has excellent cooldown clash resolution.

## Simple rotation meta-analysis

Let's look at the average ability rankings and how stable they are.

```
- HoW  : 1,1,1,1,2,5,1,5,1,1,4,1,2,2,3,4,3,6
- JoW  : 3,2,2,2,3,1,3,2,2,3,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1
- CS   : 1,3,5,5,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,3,3,5,2,1,5,2
- DS   : 5,4,3,4,5,3,6,4,5,5,3,4,4,4,4,5,4,3
- Cons : 4,5,4,3,4,4,4,3,6,4,5,7,5,3,5,3,2,4
- Exo  : 7,6,7,7,7,6,5,7,4,6,6,6,6,7,6,7,7,5
- HW   : 6,7,6,6,6,7,7,6,7,7,7,5,7,6,7,6,6,7
```

Average ranks and std deviations:

```
JoW   - 1.83 +/- 0.76
HoW   - 2.44 +/- 1.64
CS    - 2.67 +/- 1.41
DS    - 4.17 +/- 0.83
Cons  - 4.17 +/- 1.17
Exo   - 6.22 +/- 0.85
HW    - 6.44 +/- 0.60
```

So it seems like the sim places JoW/HoW/CS in a league of their own with regards to prio most of the time.
DS and Consecrate slot in nicely below that, with Exo and HW propping up the bottom of the table.

# Using these to develop a standard prio
So with that in mind, I think the following are worth adopting for a "standard rotation":

### Keep HoW at #1
Hammer of Wrath is well represented as the top ranking cast among the very highest performing prios.

There is, imo, no reason to not ever prio HoW as your top ability. It's your hardest hitting ability by some way post bug-fix, and its cooldown is relatively short at 6s; even shorter while wings is up if you glyph AW.

The effects of cooldown clash are going to be relatively low over a short execute phase where you are saturated with abilities, so you only really care about maximising the number of high-impact casts before the fight ends in an execute phase. So, get HoW off cooldown quickly and use it often. This goes doubly so if you glyph AW, which is looking very powerful atm.

### Keep JoW at #2
Even accounting for us constraining Judgement to the top 3 ranks due to mana concerns, it is still very very well represented at the top 2 spots. It hits extremely hard due to its high base damage and your Fanatacism talent boosting its critical strike chance. Hoever, the tradeoff between CS and judge appears to not amount to a whole lot. If you prio CS higher, its very short 4s cooldown probably gives you slightly more casts on average, which can overcome the higher damage Judgement.

However, when you approach a boss, you can cast JoW at range as you close in. For some bosses you rocketboot in so the effect is marginal, but on many fights you want to save boots to cheese a particular fight mechanic; and you get only one cast of them on any but the absolute longest of multi-phase fights.

As such, I think having JoW fixed at #2 will result in your opening sequence of casts naturally lend itself to syncing up with the prio over the majority of the fight, and result in you getting slightly more casts off overall.

### Keep CS at #3
In most setups, the sim and Sulis' tool show the value of keeping your CS on its short 4s cooldown. It's definitely better than any alternatives for this slot, especially when the Libram buff is taken into account.

### DS and Consecrate at #4/#5
There appears to be very little difference between Consecrate and DS over the prio meta-analysis. Over the top prios, they have exactly the same average position. They have almost exactly the same ratio of damage-per-cast/cooldown time.

There is perhaps something to be said in real-life terms for having Consecrate be on a higher priority:
1. If you cast it first on your opener, it is already doing full consecrate damage. DS's damage is partially tied up in a SoV proc, which on opener is still stacking. By delaying DS a little, you'll reliably get another melee off to stack vengeance before you cast your first DS for a bit more SoV damage, usually 3 stacks vs 2 stacks.
2. When you get into execute phase, you want to avoid a situation where you're in the last few GCDs with only Consecrate left to cast, when you're only going to get a few ticks off before the fight ends. Having it as a higher prio keeps it on cooldown in execute phase more often, so you're more likely to have a high impact instant-damage ability like DS or Exorcism to use as an alternative when you know the boss is about to die.

However, the results from Sulis' tool do not produce `HoW > JoW > CS > Cons > DS > Exo > HW` in the top 100 results.
We do see the priority system `HoW > JoW > CS > Cons > HW > Exo > DS` appear, but it's relatively far down the list, clocking in at almost 30dps behind the top contenders.
If this is statistically significant, which is admittedly hard to determine, this may be indicative of a cooldown clash issue with that particular priority that makes it less performant than other possibilities.

As such, it may be better to keep DS over Consecrate in your prio in these positions.

<!-- On the other hand, `HoW > JoW > CS > DS > Cons > Exo > HW` is the second highest ranked prio for dps, being within margin of error of the top spot.
As such, this document recommends that one should run `DS > Cons` in slot 4/5 respectively.

One should perhaps move Consecrate up in priority above DS during the execute phase, which should not drastically affect cooldown clash resolution.
 -->
 
### Exo and HW at #6/#7
With these abilities, it ultimately just comes down to their extremely long cooldowns yielding a very marginal increase to Effective Cooldown if you prio them below everything else.
If you see a sim prio one close to the top, you're probably running into N-cast edge effects. My advice would be to ignore them.

In execute, just be aware that Exo hits harder than a CS, so if you have the choice of one or another before you think the boss will die, cast the Exo.

# Our final rotation
Given these real life constraints and common-sense considerations, there is one prio listed in our tests that fits the bill very well:

`HoW > JoW > CS > DS > Cons > Exo > HW`

This prio was one of the most performant, being within the likely margin of error of the absolute highest ranking prio.
It also respects the trends that our meta-analysis indicates are shared by lots of the top-performing prios.

Your opener of Judge > CS makes sense as regards using a ranged attack as you close, and getting up your Libram's AP buff (and later on in WotLK, your Three Truths strength stacking).

It should be noted that for the opener, we discussed the possibility of casting consecrate first over DS; we note that the prio that results from switching DS and Consecrate does not feature in the top 100 prios. As such, we may tepidly conclude that its cooldown clash resolution is significantly worse than the prio we recommend.

Given the short length of execute phases, however, cooldown clash is less relevant.
I would still perhaps recommend that the user switch up their prio in execute phase to favour consecrate over DS, because keeping consecrate on cooldown at a higher priority decreases the likelihood of finding yourself locked into casting Consecrate or Holy Wrath in your last couple of GCDs.

# Caveat: Gearing
As your gear changes, the different abilities scale at different levels relative to one another.

This doc assumes a solid P1 setup. As your gear changes in coming phases, other priorities might become more viable.
