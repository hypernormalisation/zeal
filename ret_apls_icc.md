# Ret rotations and WoWSims APLs in ICC

There are two upcoming changes to the retribution rotation in Icecrown Citadel (ICC):
1. the inclusion of the Libram of Three Truths and its stacking strength buff, and
2. the ICC 2pc bonus

These, along with the very different stats on ICC gear and the powerful 4pc set bonus on judgements and seal damages, warrant a re-examination of Retribution paladin rotations and priority lists.

The recently implemented WoWSims APL provides us with a powerful environment to test out rotational considerations with the new gear.
