    "\n",
    "The CombatAnalyser is a tool to take a player and a target object, and to combine them to produce damage projections for a series of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas the sim uses the combat system's rules to generate simulation data of encounters, Zeal's core library instead projects average damages of each possible action.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows for rough appraisals of how ability damages change based on the player and target's stats (although there are still probably a few kinks to work out with regards to global damage factors in the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also allow for very robust evaluations of *relative* damage between actions, e.g. a SoB swing and a twist attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "I eventually want to feed these into a rotation generator algorithm that can use these numbers to arrive at things like optimal CS delay, by evaluating opportunity costs of the various actions."
